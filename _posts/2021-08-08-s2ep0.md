Bit of an intro for the first guest of the podcast - Will, a career-long friend in my working life.

Will's experience in the same type of industry market and similar sorts of game play backgrounds and priorities gives an interesting perspective for us to tease out and also get a feel for how we can best include guests on the podcast.
